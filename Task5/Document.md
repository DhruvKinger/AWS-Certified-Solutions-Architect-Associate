## âœ… Recommendation
While NAT Gateways offer better scalability and zero maintenance, they are significantly more expensive. For cost-sensitive environments like DevMetrics, **NAT Instances** provide a viable alternative with over **60% cost savings**, assuming the team can manage the additional operational overhead.
